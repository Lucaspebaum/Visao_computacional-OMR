# OMR-oriented-to-MCQ

This make part of computer vision courses, in this depository we use image processing to recognize mark choice in tests.

The goal of the course is to use some simple image processing methods to create an algorithm able to detect and recognize the choice in multiple-choice test based.

## Data test

This data set for test is extracted and modified from the original [data set](https://sites.google.com/view/mcq-dataset) used to obtain results the paper of [Afifi, Mahmoud, and Khaled F. Hussain.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00972.pdf)
